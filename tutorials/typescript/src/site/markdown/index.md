# Introduction

JavaScript is a dynamic functionally oriented language. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to pure javascript. When you TypeScript code, you write it as if it was a object oriented language. Compiled TypeScript code is 100% pure JavaScript that contains the code to enforce rules declared via the TypeScript syntax.

Interfaces in TypeScript work differently than interfaces in languages like Java because they are implicitly satisfied by the shape an object has.
