# What is ArchiMate.

ArchiMate is a modeling language for describing enterprise architectures. It presents a set of concepts within and relationships between architecture domains, and offers a uniform structure for describing the content of these domains.

## Services

Services play a central role in the relation between domains.

Services can be of different nature and granularity, they can be provided by organizations to their customers, by applications to business processes, or by technological facilities (e.g. communication networks) to applications.


## Layers

A layered view provides a natural way to look at service oriented models. The higher layers use services that are provided by the lower layers. Within ArchiMate three main layers are distinguished:

1. The business layer offers products and services to external customers. The offered products and services are realized in the organization by business processes performed by business actors and roles.
2. The application layer supports the business layer with application services which are realized by application components.
3. The technology layer offers infrastructural services (e.g. processing, storage, communication services) needed to run applications, and realized by servers, communication hardware, and system software.
