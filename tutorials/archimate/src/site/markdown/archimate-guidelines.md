# Guidelines

How do I model an application landscape? How do I relate logical (implementation independent) and physical business processes (implementation dependent)? How do I visualize what data are required when delivering products and/or services to customers?

These are all examples of modeling questions that an architect will be confronted with. The goal of this part is to guide architects on how they should apply ArchiMate concepts to answer the above questions. This will be done by describing proven solutions, documented as best practices.

For each documented best practice, the following structure is used:

* *Name* - A recognizable name that summarizes the contents of the best practice.
* *Context* - A description of the context that is leading to the development of the best practice.
* *Solution* - A description an visualization of the preferred solution.
* *Consequences* - A description of the consequences of the solution.
* *Alternatives* - An (optional) description of alternative solutions with the justification for each alternative.
