#Glossary

## A

* **Aggregate** - A cluster of associated objects that are treated as a unit for the purpose of data changes. External references are restricted to one member of the `Aggregate`, designated as the root. A set of consistency rules applies within the `Aggregate`'s boundaries.
* **Analysis pattern** - A group of concepts that represents a common construction in business modeling. It may be relevant to only 1 domain or may span many domains (resource fowler 1997, p. 8)
* **Assertion** - A statement of the correct state of a program at some point, independent of how it does it. Typically a `Assertion` specifies the result of an operation or the required input for and operation.

## B

* **Bounded Context** - The delimited applicability of a particular model. Bounding contexts gives team members a clear and shared understanding of what has to be consistent and what can be developed independently.

## C

* **Client** - A program element that is calling the element under design, using its capabilities.
* **Cohesion** - Logical agreement and dependence.
* **Command** - An operation that causes some change to the system (for example, setting a variable).
* **Context** - The setting in which a word or statement appears that determines its meaning.
* **Context Map** - A representation of the [Bounded Context](#Bounded_Context)s involved in a project and the actual relationships between them and their models.
* **Core Domain** - The distinctive part of the model, central to the user's goals, that differentiates the application and makes it valuable.

## D

* **DDD** - See [Domain Driven Design](#Domain_Driven_Design).
* **Declarative Design** - A form of programming in which a precise description of properties actually controls the software.
* **Domain Driven Design** - Domain Driven Design is not a technology or a methodology. DDD provides a structure of practices and terminology for making design decissions that focus and accelerate software projects dealing with complicated domains.

## M

* **Modifier** - See [Command](#Command).

## U

* **Ubiquitous Language** - A language structured around the domain model and used by all team members to connect all activities of the team with the software.
