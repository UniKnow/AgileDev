# Introduction Domain Driven Design.

The philosophy of Domain Driven Design (DDD), firstly described by Eric Evans, is about placing our attention at the heart of the application, focusing on the complexity that is intrinsic to the business domain itself. We also distinguish the *core domain* (unique to the business) from the supporting sub-domains (typically generic in nature, such as `money` and `time`), and place appropriately more of our efforts on the core.

Domain Driven Design consists of a set of patterns for building enterprise applications based on the domain model. Within this introduction we are going to run through some of the main patterns of DDD.
