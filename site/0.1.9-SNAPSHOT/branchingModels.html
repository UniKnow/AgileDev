            <h1>Branching Models</h1>
<p>Within the following paragraphs will discuss some of the popular branching models which are around these days. After reading this you should be able to decide which one fits your project the most.</p>
<div class="section">
<h2>Git-Flow<a name="Git-Flow"></a></h2>
<p>This workflow has been published by <a class="externalLink" href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Vincent Driesen</a> as a successful branching model for git and covers most of the standard needs for a &#x2018;classical&#x2019; development project.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3>How it works<a name="How_it_works"></a></h3>
<p>Git-Flow has the following branching model:</p>
<p><img src="images/git-flow-branching-model.jpg" alt="Git-Flow branching model" /></p>
<p>There are 2 primary branches:</p>

<ul>
  
<li><tt>master</tt> is the main branch where everything is stable. Each commit is a stable (fully tested) version of the project, (i.e. a release) which could be deployed to production and tagged accordingly.</li>
  
<li><tt>develop</tt> is the main branch where development is done. It will contain prepared changes for the next release in <tt>master</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And secondary branches which are flexible over time:</p>

<ul>
  
<li><tt>feature</tt> starts from <tt>develop</tt> and merge into <tt>develop</tt>. When you are working on a specific feature, you create a <tt>feature\xxx</tt> branch and once it&#x2019;s done, you merge it back into <tt>develop</tt> to add the stable feature to the scope for the next release. The essence of a <tt>feature</tt> branch is that it exists as long as the feature is in development, but will eventually be merged back into <tt>develop</tt> or discarded.</li>
  
<li><tt>release</tt> starts from <tt>develop</tt> and merge into <tt>master</tt> and/or <tt>develop</tt>. When <tt>develop</tt> is reflecting the desired state of the feature release, (all features for the release haven been merged), you create a &#x2018;release/xxx&#x2019; branch. By doing this, you can prepare the next release, correct eventual bugs and continue development in parallel. All features targeted at future releases may not be merged into the <tt>develop</tt> branch until the <tt>release</tt> branch is branched off. It is exactly at the start of a release branch that the upcoming release gets a version number assigned.</li>
  
<li><tt>hotfix</tt> starts from <tt>master</tt> and merge into <tt>master</tt> and/or <tt>develop</tt>/<tt>release</tt>. When you want quickly to resolve critical bugs in production you create a <tt>hotfix/xxx</tt> branch. When the hotfix is developed, you merge it back into <tt>master</tt> with the appropriate version number, and into <tt>develop</tt> and/or <tt>release</tt> branch to update it with the modifications you made.</li>
</ul></div></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>GitHub<a name="GitHub"></a></h2>
<p>GitHub has the following branching model:</p>
<p><img src="images/github-flow-branching-model.jpg" alt="GitHub branching model" /></p>
<p>As you can see in the picture above, there is only a single <tt>master</tt> branch and the following 6 basic rules should be followed:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  
<li><b>Everything that is in <tt>master</tt> could be deployed in production</b> - The <tt>master</tt> branch is the only meaningful branch of the project and it should stay stable in any circumstance so you can base your work upon and deploy it to production at anytime.</li>
  
<li><b>Create descriptive feature branches from <tt>master</tt></b> - When you want to develop a feature or a hotfix, you just create your branch from <tt>master</tt> with an explicit name that describe your work.</li>
  
<li><b>Regularly push to <tt>origin</tt></b> - In contrary of the Git-Flow where developers doesn&#x2019;t have to push its local <tt>feature</tt> branch to the main repo, you have to do that regularly within the GitHub model.</li>
  
<li><b>Open a pull-request at anytime</b></li>
  
<li><b>Only merge after a pull request review</b> - This is more an advice than an absolute rule. It&#x2019;s a best practice that another developer should review the pull request and confirm that the branch is stable. From here you can, merge the branch back into <tt>master</tt> and delete the <tt>merge</tt> branch.</li>
  
<li><b>Immediately deploy after you merge into <tt>master</tt></b> - Once your branch is merged into <tt>master</tt> the whole thing is deployed to production. Doing so, you will stress on the necessite to keep <tt>master</tt> stable. Developers don&#x2019;t want to break everything because of its modifications were deployed, so they are more likely to pay attention to code stability before merge.</li>
</ol>
<p>The GitHub model perfectly fits projects that don&#x2019;t have releases nor versions.</p>
<p>You do continuously integrate into <tt>master</tt> and you deploy the stable project to production regularly; sometimes several time a day.</p>
<p>Due to this it&#x2019;s very unlikely to add serries of big bugs. If problems appear, they are quickly fixed on the go. There is no difference between a big feature and a small hotfix in terms of process.</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Final words<a name="Final_words"></a></h2>
<p>To choose the best model depends on the nature and needs of your project. It&#x2019;s up to you to consider which of these models fit more or less to your environment. If necessary adapt the framework to your needs.</p></div>
