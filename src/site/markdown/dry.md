# DRY Principle

The Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle is aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds. The DRY principle is stated as 'Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system'. When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements. Additionally, elements that are logically related all change predictably and uniformly and are thus kept in sync.
