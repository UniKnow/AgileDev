# Building blocks Domain Driven Design

The diagram below is a navigational map. It shows the patterns that form the building blocks of Domain Driven Design and how they relate to each other.

By using these standard patterns we bring order in the design and make it easier for team members to understand each other's work. Using standard patterns also adds to the *ubiquitous language* which all team members can use to discuss model and design discussions.
