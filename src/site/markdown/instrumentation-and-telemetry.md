# Instrumentation & Telemetry

Most applications will include additional instrumentation that generates log entries which are required to monitor and debug the system. However, in large systems the huge volume of data collected can overwhelm simple monitoring systems/techniques. Instead, you can implement a telemetry solution that collects and highlights operational events and reduces management costs, while at the same time giving insights into the application behavior.
