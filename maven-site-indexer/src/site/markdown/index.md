# Maven Site Indexer plugin

An easy way to index your maven site and give it a nice ajax search box.

It's as easy as:

1. adding the plugin to your `pom.xml` [usage instructions](usage.html) - of course it should already have the `site` plugin configured
2. calling `mvn site`
3. opening up your site and enjoying your nice and hassle-free search box!
