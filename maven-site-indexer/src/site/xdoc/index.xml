            <p>
               An easy way to index your maven site and give it a nice ajax search box.
            </p>
            <p>It's <b>as easy as</b>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>adding the plugin to your pom.xml (see <a href="usage.html">usage instructions</a> - of course it should already have the site plugin configured)</li>
                <li>putting searchbox.html in src/site/resources (you can customize it if you have a good javascript-fu)
<source>//in example you can change the positioning
$("#searchbox", window.parent.document).css('top', '10px');
$("#searchbox", window.parent.document).css('left', $(window).width()- 325);
...
&lt;!-- or change the color of the search results box -->
&lt;div style="background-color: lightyellow" id="searchOutput"/&gt;</source>
			 	</li>
                <li>putting search.js in src/site/resources/js (just put it as it is)</li>
                <li>calling mvn site</li>
                <li>opening up your site and enjoying your nice and hassle-free search box!</li>
            </ul>
